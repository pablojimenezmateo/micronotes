# Tech debt

Known debt, each with a stable id so a comment in the code can point at it and a
commit message can close it. One entry per thing, and every entry says what it
costs today and why it has not been paid — an entry with no cost and no reason
is a preference, not debt, and does not belong here.

Performance debt that is part of a measured narrative lives in
`docs/performance.md` under its `### Open:` headings; those are cross-referenced
below rather than duplicated, because that file carries the numbers and the
history that make them make sense.

**Adding an entry:** take the next free number, never reuse one. Closing an
entry means deleting it and saying so in the commit; a register of things that
turned out to be fine is a register nobody reads.

## TD-6 — performance debt tracked in `docs/performance.md`

Not repeated here. Each is a `### Open:` section with its own numbers:

- an edit still touches every block below it (materialised positions vs. a
  Fenwick tree) — written down as the thing to reach for *if the shift shows
  up*, not as a fix waiting to happen
- the staging tokens are built only to be thrown away
- the cache sweep frees what the next relayout is about to allocate
  (unmeasured, and it undoes a decision that file already justified: measure
  `peak_rss` before touching it)

## TD-14 — the raw pane still lays its own text out

`src/app/RawPane.cpp`.

The live page and the reading pane are one renderer now (`doc::Layout`'s token
flow through `PageView`). The raw pane is the third engine, and it is still
there: its own soft wrap over `editor::WrappedLines`, its own line stepping, its
own scrollbar arithmetic against the page rect the other two share.

**What it costs today.** Every typographic decision that reaches all three panes
is two decisions rather than one. That is down from three, and the one that is
left is the one furthest from the others: the raw pane deliberately shows the
file as bytes, so its line breaks are the file's and not the layout's.

**Why it is still here.** `RawPane`'s own header says it is "kept apart so that
replacing it is a matter of deleting one file", which is the right plan. What it
is waiting for is a decision rather than a refactor: whether a pane that shows
the source *as a monospaced file* is a thing this app wants at all now that the
live surface reveals a block's markers under the caret and drops a `Complex`
block to raw source when you click into it. If it is not, the file deletes; if
it is, it is meant to be a different engine, and the debt is only the geometry
it duplicates -- which `ui::pageRectIn` and `ui::pageColumnIn` already hold.
