// The editor stores text as UTF-8 bytes and addresses the caret by byte offset,
// which is the right representation -- it makes every edit an ordinary string
// splice. What it must not do is *move* the caret a byte at a time: stepping
// left through "café" one byte at a time lands in the middle of the combining
// accent, and erasing one byte from there leaves an invalid sequence that
// renders as a replacement character. These helpers step whole code points
// instead.

// True for a UTF-8 continuation byte (10xxxxxx) -- a byte that is part of a
// multi-byte sequence but not its start.

// step, so an offset already on a boundary is returned unchanged. This is what

// The rest of this header walks boundaries without ever asking what is between
// them, because the editor never needs to know: a caret moves over characters
// and a splice copies bytes. Anything that has to *identify* a character does
// -- the PDF exporter asks a font which glyph a code point is -- and that is
// this.
//
// A byte that starts no valid sequence decodes as U+FFFD and advances by one,
// so a walk over broken input terminates and stays in step with the byte
// offsets either side of it rather than resynchronising somewhere else.
